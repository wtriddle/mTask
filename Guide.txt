Tasks:
Every task has a default routine container called Tasks. The Tasks container contains all tasks ever created by the user. Selecting the Tasks container when editing a task
will edit the default settings for the task. These properties are carried over initially into every new routine created, but can be altered to tailor specifically to that 
routine.

Routines:
Each routine has a set of tasks which are unique to itself. It cannot have the same task more than once, but multiple routines can access the same task. 
When a task is added to a routine, it will carry over the same task time and description from its default properties, specified in the Tasks container. However, when a task
is added to a new routine, then the task can be specifically altered under the routine to have a unique description and time for that routine.
